ABC 123 DESYGN ‚Ñ¢ (CUSTOM) A.I TOOL FOR MODELING AGENCY derived from MAGNETRON ‚Ñ¢ research. This features a Dreambooth model trained from 1.5 with VAE on a diverse set of photographs of people. The goal was to create a model focused on full to medium body shots, with an emphasis on cool clothing and a fashion-shoot aesthetic.

This is a machine learning model trained on a diverse set of colourized photographs from the 1880s-1980s.

Use the activation token **timeless style** in your prompt (I recommend at the start)

The goal of this model was to create striking images with rich tones and an anachronistic feel.

When using this model, I typically use **painted illustration blur haze monochrome** in my negative prompt. I encourage you to experiment and see what works well for you.

Trained from 1.5 with VAE.

Please see [this document for parameters (prompt, sampler, seed, etc.) used for all example images.](https://huggingface.co/wavymulder/timeless-diffusion/resolve/main/parameters_for_samples.txt)
